# TTU-Line-Following-Rover


register level C code to control a line following rover to race while avoiding collisions. The line following will be accomplished using IR sensors, which output a Boolean signal when a line is detected. Collision avoidance must be accomplished using an ultrasonic sensor, which outputs an echo pulse proportionate to the echo time. The motors will be controlled using an H-bridge motor controller.
